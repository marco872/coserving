				<hr>
				<p>Governments and Institutional funds
provide investment to create  Private Liquidity Pools (pLP). </p><p>pLPs use  fiat capital  to finance Design/Build (D/B)  
projects for the community.</p><p> Tokens (FBM token) generate a retribution system for the communityâ€™s users of the D/B projects.</p>
