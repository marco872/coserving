           <h6> <strong><u style="color:red;">Why using Blockchain Network(W3) instead of W2 app ? </u>
</strong> </h6>


<p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> With WEB.3, Co-Serving data generated by  different and increasingly powerful compiuting resources, including mobile phones, desktopes, appliences, vehicles and sensors, will be sold by users through decentralized data networks,ensuring that users retain ownership control.</p>
<p><strong>Trustless and permissionless:</strong> In addition to decentralization and being based upon open source software, Web 3 will also be trustless (i.e., the network will allow participants to interact directly without going through a trusted intermediary) and permissionless (meaning that anyone can participate without authorization from a governing body). As a result, Web 3 applications will run on blockchains or decentralized peer-to-peer networks, or a combination thereofâ€”such decentralized apps are referred to as dApps.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning:</strong> In Web 3, Co-Serving will be able to use  data and algorithms to create rel estate developments, gradually improving its performances. These capabilities will enable computers to produce faster and more relevant results in  real estate impact developments.
<p><strong>Connectivity and ubiquity:</strong> With Web 3, Co-Serving information and content are more connected and ubiquitous, accessed by multiple applications and with an increasing number of everyday devices connected to the web.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi):</strong> Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing governments,investors, property oners, tenants and guests to conduct financial transactions through  peer-to-peer financial networks that use Smart Contracts  in Ethereum security protocols. From anywhere you have an internet connection, you can  verify financial actions in distributed financial databases. A distributed database is accessible across various locations; it collects and aggregates data from all users and uses a <u>consensus mechanism </U> to verify it. Decentralized finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are. DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.</u></p>
